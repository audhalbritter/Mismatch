# Plant-pollinator interactions along snowmelt gradients at Finse in Norway.


Description: This study investigates plant-pollinator interactions and reproduction in the pollinator-generalist plant species Ranunculus acris L. along a snowmelt gradient in the alpine area of Finse in western Norway over two growing seasons (2016 and 2017).
The snowmelt gradient creates patches with different times of snowmelt, and thus onset of flowering.
The spatial distribution of flowering and pollinator activity is used to investigate whether sub-populations with different times of flowering experience different synchrony with their pollinators, assessing the potential for temporal plant-pollinator mismatches.
In addition, a hand-pollination experiment was conducted to investigate whether a sub-populationâ€™s synchrony with its pollinators affects plant reproductive ability.
